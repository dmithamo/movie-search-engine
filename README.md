# Movie Search Engine
### Building a Search Engine that Utilizes an API (omdb API -  [ http://www.omdbapi.com/ ]) as I learn node.js 

### Technologies used in this app:
* Javascript, specifically `Node.js` , and frameworks thereof (specifically, `express`)
* HTML
* CSS

### Installation

This app requires Node.js installed to run. 
Clone the repo, install the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file and start the server. That is:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dmithamo/movie-search-engine
$ cd movie-search-engine
$ npm install -d
$ node app.js
```
You should see `Server is running...` on your terminal if all went well.
And voila! Access `localhost:3000` on your favorite browser (of course I mean **Chrome**. duh!) and you are good to go. Search away! 

### Todos
